title: Korea Again ??
location: Korea

Hello friends and family! It's been a while 😅 I've been too busy traveling to write about my travels - first around China with my family, then to India with my brother, then to Nepal for a 10 day meditation retreat. All will be expounded upon in further detail post by post - but first! An appetizer 😁 I took another trip to Korea to meet up with my close college friend Paul Choi - in our very first semester of college we were pair programming partners, a bond that can never be broken. He brought a friend as well, Kimberly.

Pictures!

Let me tell you just how many noodles I had. I had so many noodles. The Korean diet seems to consist of two things: meat and noodles. And as a recently ordained vegetarian, my only choice was noodles.

Being a vegetarian in Korea was surprisingly tricky. Besides the dearth of non-noodle meals, it was difficult to pick up a quick snack or pick me up from the corner markets. The last time I went to Korea I fell in love with the Onigiri. Little triangles of rice stuffed with tuna and mayo or beef or marinated steak... But no veggie options 😣

Well, I should clarify. There are still many options for vegetarians, but for some reason *none* of them are savory. Not a single one. There are egg and cheese and jam sandwiches for crying out loud. Why add jam??? One time I got so desperate that I bought a ham and cheese sandwich and threw away the ham. But the mayo was still sweet...

Besides eating a lot of noodles we (I) also drank a lot!

Unlike China, Koreans actually use cheese in their cooking, something I dearly missed. So I loaded up while I could.

These "Sunday Cheezzzballs" were actually unintentionally hilarious:

I guess that makes me a "solitary modern person who leads a busy life" 😂

We found the Cheezzzballs (and a whole mini-theme park) at the top of Namsan Park, a large hill located in central Seoul. The climb makes for great views!

One of the days we found our way to the [Dongdaemun design plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongdaemun_Design_Plaza). The main highlight was, by far, these spinny chairs we found.

After that we went to the city walls - which I just _had_ to take a climb on.

And what visit to Seoul is complete without karaoke?!

After bidding goodbye to Seoul we hopped on a train to the other corner of the country - Busan. Korea is so small it still only took two or three hours. And yes, we did watch [Train to Busan](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5700672/) the night before 😂

Busan had a couple of highlights. The Gamcheon culture village...

Which had more green roofs...

A beautiful beach...

The final night of our trip we spent playing the ancient Korean game of Hold 'Em. I should've won, but Paul got lucky...

And that's it for Korea! Seoul continues to be one of my absolute favorite cities I've ever visited - it's so dense that it feels like no matter where you go when you turn the corner there's always something new to do/see/eat/drink. From Korea I hopped on a plane to Hong Kong, which you'll have to stay tuned for.
