You wake up to your 4:30 AM alarm.

[+30 exhastion]

It's pitch black both inside and outside. As your bleary senses open up you process the sound of pitter patter on the roof: rain.

[-50 motivation]

[1.5 hours till sunrise]
You can:
1. Get up and prepare to set out for Poon Hill
2. Go back to bed
```

<!-- body -->

Oh, my god, it's so early, and I'm so exhausted and it's raining out, which means that the walk is gonna suck, and also means that it's probably cloudy up at the top right? So we wouldn't even get to see the sunrise anyways, which means it would *definitely* not be worth it, and let's just go back to bed, you agree don't you Osmanthus? Yes, you agree...

```
> sleep more

You set a new alarm and lie back down in bed, drifting off right away.

...zzz...

[-30 exhastuion]

You wake up to your 6:30 AM alarm, feeling much more refreshed. The sun is rising and the rain has tapered to a drizzle.

[+30 motivation]

[12.5 hours till sunset]
You can:
1. Get up and prepare to set out for Poon Hill
2. Go back to bed
```

No no, we can get up now. After all we have a whole day of hiking to do *after* we go up and down Poon Hill.

```
> get our lazy asses up

You collect your things and bring them down to the common area. The lodge will allow you to keep your packs here and grab them once you come back down from Poon Hill. You stuff your coat full of snacks and borrow an umbrella from the lodge.

[12 hours till sunset]
You can:
1. Have breakfast
2. Set out for Poon Hill
3. Set out for Tadapani
```

We already missed the sunrise, so may as well have something to eat and let the rain wear itself out.

```
> breakfast

You order some muesli and load it up with lots of honey, sipping on a NescafeÂ® instant coffee.

[-â‚¹500][-30 exhaustion][+20 motivation]

[11 hours till sunset]
You can:
1. Set out for Poon Hill
2. Set out for Tadapani
```

Well we're still gonna go see Poon Hill... after all that's the name of the game!

```
> poon hill

The rain has mostly abated and halfway through the hour hike up you put the umbrella away.
```

You stop every so often to admire the nice views on the way up, gray as they might be at the moment.

But it's the panoramic view of the mountain range that opens up as you crest the top that is truly stunning.

[+100 motivation]

Marred only by the swathes of clouds covering the tops of the mountains.

[-20 motivation]

It's mostly free of other people, and the tea stand is closed, so you figure that most people must have come up for the sunrise.
```

Fools.

```
You walk around and snap some pics and have a bite to eat while enjoying the view.

[9.5 hours till sunset]
You can:
1. Stay longer hoping the clouds will clear out
2. Head back to Ghorepani and retreive your things
```

We still need to make it to Tadapani today. Can't spend all day waiting for clouds...

```
> head back

You make the trek back...

... return the umbrella, and grab your things.

[8.5 hours till sunset]
You can:
1. Set out for Tadapani
2. Do some shopping
3. Have lunch in Ghorepani
```

Osmanthus is still afraid of her stuff getting thoroughly soaked again, so she wants to pick up a backpack cover in case it rains.

```
> shop

Ghorepani, being a larger town, has a shop or two dedicated just to hiking gear. There you guys find hiking poles, water bottles, backpacks, boots, trail snacks, and a backpack cover.

> more water, backpack cover

Osmanthus [+20 motivaton]

[7.5 hours till sunset]
You can:
1. Set out for Tadapani
2. Have lunch in Ghorepani
```

We've spent enough time here. Let's get out of this town!

```
> onwards!

The first part of the trek is relatively horizontal, passing over the ridge of the mountains here. It affords some spectaular views of its own looking down into the valleys.
```

<div class="post-image">

```
You stop for a quick rest, sitting on a small stone outcropping. Suddenly, Osmanthus jumps to her feet and screams. Clinging to her wrist is a very small leech.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OSMANTHUS VS SMALL LEECH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The leech uses [is gross]! The attack is super effective! Osmanthus [+50 panic]
Osmanthus uses [scream]! The leech has no ears, and the attack fails!
Your move [salt/flick/smash/run]:
> salt
You attempt to use [salt]! The salt is deep in your backpack, and you can't get to it in time. The attack fails!
The leech uses [super gross]! The attack is super effective! Osmanthus [+50 panic][+50 desperation]
Osmanthus uses [smash]! She picks up a rock and prepares to attack the leech!
Your move [salt/flick/block/run]:
> block
You use [block]! You grab Osmanthus and forcefully prevent her from breaking her own wrist with a rock in order to subdue the 1 centimeter leech. Osmanthus [+50 rage]
The leech uses [really so super gross]! The attack is super effective! Osmanthus [+50 panic][+50 desperation][+50 lifelong fear of leeches]
Osmanthus' panic levels are too high and she is unable to take an action!
Your move [salt/flick/smash/run]:
> flick
You steady Osmanthus' arm long enough to [flick] the leech off.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU WIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
```

Ok, ok, it's ok Osmanthus, it's ok, calm down, it's alright, it's gone now, no more leech, yes I know it was gross but it's ok, it's gone now...

```
After a minute or two you manage to coax Osmanthus into moving again, and once she starts she never wants to stop in case there are more leeches waiting to attack.

After some time you arrive at what you think at first might be Deurali, but quickly realize is just an overlook point containing just two similar looking lodges with identical menus.

[6.5 hours until sunset]
You can:
1. Stop and have some lunch
2. Continue on to Deurali
```

Fake Deurali. But we're hungry, and Osmanthus needs some time to recover from her leech encounter.

```
> eat

You pick the lodge with fewer customers and let Osmanthus order whatever she wants (mo:mo and chai).
```

<div class="post-image">
  <img src="/assets/poon-hill-trail/2019_09_19_13_56_20.jpg">
</div>

```
While waiting for the food, you check yourself for leeches and find a small one clinging to the top of your right foot, just below your big toe. You're not surprised - your shoes are full of holes and practically invite the leeches in - but you're careful not to let Osmanthus see as you dab it with some salt and peel it off. It never even made it through the sock, so your feet are undamaged.

The food comes out and you eat with gusto.

[-â‚¹800][-30 exhastion]

[5.5 hours until sunset]
You can:
1. Continue on toward Deurali
2. Rest a bit longer
```

Osmanthus seems to have recovered enough from the shock to continue forward.

```
> on to real deurali

An hour and a half of hiking upon the mountain ridges brings you to Deurali. The views down the side of the mountain are still spectacular, but you've had your fill of pictures, and Osmanthus doesn't want to stand still anymore in case there are more leeches.

Deurali is a little larger, and actually has places to stay.

[4 hours until sunset]
You can:
1. Continue onwards towards Ban Thanti
2. Stop for a snack
3. Stop for the day
```

We're full, we're making good time, let's keep at it.

```
> into the breach

You start making your way down into the gulf that separates you from Tadapani.
```

<div class="post-image">
  <img src="/assets/poon-hill-trail/2019_09_19_16_04_38.jpg">
</div>

```
As the trail turns into stairs, you suddenly find yourself unable to keep up with Osmanthus who races ahead down the stone stairway, while your knees complain on every step you take too quickly. During the descent you become buried in the foliage and lose the view of the valley. You discover the path follows a gentle river down the hillside.
```

<div class="post-image">
  <img src="/assets/poon-hill-trail/2019_09_19_17_00_05.jpg">

```
After an hour, you arrive in Ban Thanti, knees creaking.

[3 hours till sunset]
You can:
1. Stop for dinner
2. Continue on to Tadapani
3. Stay in Ban Thanti for the night
```

The final part of the hike conquers the V of the valley - we'll go to the bottom then back up, including a brutal set of stairs for about 300 meters. But Osmanthus says she's up for it, and it's always nice to have less to do tomorrow.

```
> grind it out

You continue onward and make it down into the bottom of the valley. All that lies between you and your desitination is a nearly vertical set of stairs.

[-30 motivation]
```

Oh no, it didn't seem so bad when it was merely theoretical...

```
You make the final ascent up the stairs.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PARTY VS STEEP STAIRS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The stairs use [so steep]! The damage goes stright to your thighs! Your thighs are on fire!
Your move [rest/pray/cry/plead]:
> plead
You attempt to use [plead]! Despite your deepest entreaties, the stairs do not let up. The attack fails!
Osmanthus uses [staunch determination]! She ignores your mumbling and strives forwards.
The stairs use [never-ending]! [-30 motivaton]!
Your move [rest/pray/cry/plead]:
> rest
You use [rest]! You give your legs a chance to recover. [+20 motivation]
Osmanthus uses [self-delusion]! The end must be close. Just around this bend... [+20 motivation]
The stairs use [leveling-off]! The attack is innefective! [+20 motivation]!
Your move [rest/pray/cry/plead]:
> push through it!
You use the extra motivation to reach deep within yourself and [push through it]! You surmount the final section of the stairs!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU WIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
```

Oh god, oh please, my legs have been replaced with fiery pools of lava ðŸ˜£

```
After defeating the stairs you stumble the last several hundred meters to Tadapani.

Tadapani is situated on a crest and has some excellent views of the Annapurna range.

[2 hours until sunset]
You can:
1. Stay at Grand View Lodge [-â‚¹300][+ view of Annapurna]
2. Stay at Hotel Super Viewpoint [-â‚¹500][+ view of Annapurna]
3. Stay at Hotel Tadapani Guest House [-â‚¹200]
```

Not even close. Grand View is clearly the best choice. Just gotta climb one last tiny hill ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

```
> grand view

Not only do you get a room on the second floor, looking out at the Annapurna range, but it also has four beds!

[-â‚¹300][+10 motivation]

[1.5 hours until sunset]
You can:
1. Have some dinner
2. Admire the view
3. Go to sleep
```

We have some extra time, let's take a break.

```
> admire the view

The sun is already low in the sky and the clouds have not dissapated all day, so the mountain is dark and obscured. But you're sure it'll be an amazing view in the morning.
```

[+5 motivation]

[1 hours until sunset]
You can:
1. Have some dinner
2. Go to sleep

> dinner

The lodge is bustling with other groups of hikers. While eating a filling platter of Dahl Bhat you strike up conversation with the Singaporeans on your left and the Australians on your right, and after dinner listen in on the group of older British men chat about buying a new computer with Windows 10. Nepal is so multicultural!

```
[sunset]
You can:
1. Hang out in the lodge longer
2. Go to sleep
```

We want to get up at sunrise tomorrow (for real this time) in order to catch the sun coming up over the mountains, so we should head to bed.

```
> sleep

You prepare for sleep and choose which two of the four beds you'll be resting in. The rooms next to you also have groups, and they stay up late chatting amongst themselves, their voices carrying through the thin walls. You somehow manage to drift off...

...zzz...
