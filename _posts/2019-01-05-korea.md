China doesn't actually celebrate Christmas (圣诞节 shengdanjie "Jesus' Birthday"). Lights are hung up, Christmas songs are played, fake Christmas trees are erected... but on the 25th of December everyone still goes to work.

After my [single's day post][1], I learned that there is also a [double twelve][2] holiday. Aghast at the boldness of *pulling the exact same trick* two months in a row, I asked around among my Chinese friends to see if this holiday also had a backstory. They all said no. This time it really is just bald-faced consumerism...

</div>

Christmas similarly seems to be used as yet another grab at consumer's wallets. Malls and shops dress themselves up and run deals in order to try and entice people to spend just a little more, but as gift giving is not a practiced tradition here they probably have less success than in the West. Most of the locals I talked to just planned to go out for a nice dinner with their friends, after work of course.

The very idea of working on Christmas made my Western blood curdle. So within my first two weeks at Microsoft I asked my mentor if I could have that whole Christmas week off. He was very nice, and probably saw the panic in my eyes, and so amicably agreed. "We'll just say you'll come in on some weekends to make those days up." Oh... great... 😅😅😅

A whole work week off plus the two adjacent weekends makes plenty of time to travel. Me and my friend who was coming back to Asia over the holidays wanted to go skiing in Japan - but the plane tickets were $500 round trip. Korea on the other hand was $250. Who even wants to go to Japan anyways?

So we booked our tickets, booked our lodging, found the ski resort and made sure there was a bus that got us from Seoul to Yongpyeong (the ski town). We were set!

### Saturday, December 22nd

The first day of the trip. My flight was around 8PM and landed in Korea close to 10. Korea is actually an hour ahead of China, despite being so close.

  <p class="post-image-caption">Korea is obsessed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_Friends">Line Friends</a>. This giant stuffed bear is one of the several Line Friends' characters, and is one of the first things you see in the airport after stepping off the plane.</p>

### Sunday, December 23rd

  <p class="post-image-caption">Our first proper meal in Korea was lunch at a random place in the train station. The waiter, seeing we were two people, brought out bowls of rice. When we proceeded to only order one dish to split (we weren't too hungry) she took one of the bowls of rice away 😂😂😂</p>
</div>

I had expected Korea to be on par or cheaper than China - to my suprise prices were just about even with America. The exchange rate is far easier to keep a handle on: it's 1 USD to 1,119 Korean Won. When looking at prices you can just treat the comma like a decimal point, easy! This one bowl of soup was almost 10,000 Won, so about $10.

After checking into the Airbnb, we went to what was apparently the largest wholesale market in South Korea (and probably North).

  <p class="post-image-caption">Nearby we found a cool looking historical site. It turns out this was the south gate of Seoul for many centuries (since the 1300's!) It was walking under this arch that I was really struck by the weight of the history in this part of the world for the first time since coming to Asia. In America, (non-Native) history is necessarily no older than 400 years. And most of Beijing (especially the area I frequent) is relatively new. But Korean people had been using this gate for nearly a millenia. A millenia! Hard to wrap one's mind around.</p>

According to my friend, this dish was originally only eaten by soldiers in the military, and was popularized by some Korean dramas. Wikipedia disagrees with her, saying "although the dish was born in the period of post-war impoverishment, it continued to be popular during the period of rapid growth, and is still popular today". She specifically wanted us to come to this place, but I'm not sure why because the dish was chock full of meat and she's a vegetarian... She managed to negotiate some free tofu 😂</p>

We decided rather than freeze while walking around Hongdae for a second day in a row, it might be fun to take the metro over to Ehwas Woman's University, famous for it's architecture, and freeze over there.
