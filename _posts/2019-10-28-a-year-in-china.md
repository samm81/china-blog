title: A Year in China
location: Nanjing, China

On October 28th, 2018, exactly one year ago, I stepped off a 14 hour flight from Washington DC to Beijing. The very start of Sam's Trip to China! I had been talking about this, planning for this, applying for documents for this and dreaming about this for the past two years. I walked down the terminal grinning ear to ear as I delightedly tried to read all the Chinese. I had made it!

But besides excitement there was fear. This was only my second time traveling to a foreign continent, and my first time traveling to a country where I needed a Visa. I was afraid that something would go wrong at customs. I waited for my bag at the carousel so long I was convinced it had been seized. I thought Microsoft was gonna cancel my internship when they realized I wasn't attending a real grad school. I'm pretty sure my bank came very close to refusing to open a bank account for me, without which I would not have been able to receive my wages. The registration officer at the police station stared at my Visa so long I was sure I was going to be arrested. But none of it came to pass. The most trouble I've ever gotten into in China is when a public transportation officer noticed that someone hadn't paid proper fare and assumed it was me since I was a foreigner. I don't always understand all the rules and regulations posted, but I actually had paid properly that time!

I'm really glad that I had the opportunity to spend my first six months at Microsoft getting settled in. My two years of college Chinese were definitely not enough. I remember trying to order a coffee when I first arrived - I had to ask him to repeat, several times, every single sentence he said 😂 I could barely navigate the metro, I dreaded getting a call from a delivery driver, and booking a place to stay on my own was out of the question. But one Saturday afternoon, four months after my arrival, I walked into a restaurant all on my own, picked out a dish, ordered, ate, and paid all without a hitch. I felt ready to strike off on my own 😎

Of course, I still had two months of my internship left 😴

But I waited patiently, and at the end of April I packed my bags and moved on from the tutorial zone, eager to make the most of the next half of the year 😁

For those who like numbers, in sum it's 38 visits to 26 unique destinations 😎

Inevitably the question comes: which was your favorite? Beijing really feels like my home here in Asia, as you could probably guess from the sheer number of times I ended up returning to it. It's the city I'm most familiar with and I have a couple friends there. But I can't say it's my favorite - [living in Beijing is really convenient](/2019/06/06/beijing/) but it's also crowded, congested, polluted and too big. My favorite city I've ever had a chance to visit is probably 杭州 (Hangzhou). It has the country famous 龙井 (longjing, "dragon well") tea, it has the lively 宋街 (songjie, "Song Dynasty Street") for picking up a bite to eat, and it's got the got the gorgeous 西湖 (Xihu, "West Lake") which, in contrast to Beijing, is where both the tourists *and* the locals go to while away a day.

成都 (Chengdu), 南京 (Nanjing), 武汉 (Wuhan), 大同 (Datong) and 青岛 (Qingdao) are all runner ups, but it can be difficult to pull apart how much you enjoyed a city from the conditions you visited it under - I visited most of these cities _outside_ of peak tourist season which makes a big difference.

Outside of China, I was also a huge fan of Seoul both time I went - the city is so dense it feels like no matter where you go or what corner you turn there's always something new to see/do/eat/drink. My four day hike up Poon Hill in Pokhara, Nepal was also pretty incredible, but you'll see more about that in a future post!
