title: Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
location: People's Republic of China
---

My Chinese last name is “马”. It's a common last name, often used by Muslim-Chinese, and it's literal meaning is "horse". My first year Chinese teacher picked it our for me because it's an approximate transliteration; the character is pronounced "mah" kind of like the first syllable of "Maynard".

So when my whole family, [Dad], [Max], and [Eli] came to visit, we were four 马 running around. We took to calling ourselves the four horsemen of the apocalypse.

[Dad]: https://www.normanmaynard.com/
[Max]: https://www.instagram.com/maxwell.byrne/
[Eli]: http://maynards.site/

Shepherding the three of them around was not easy! Eli had spent the last six weeks up in 上海 (Shanghai) as a camp counselor and had learned just enough Chinese to get himself into trouble. The other two knew nothing, besides, of course, 你好 (nihao "hello") and 谢谢 (xiexie "thank you"). Max managed to pick up phrases like "I wish you peace" throughout the course of the trip, but certainly nothing useful like "I want two bowls of noodles" 😂

But we made it through in one piece! The nearly 900 photo album on google attests to our adventures - and below you'll find a distilled version of it. All four of use went through every item and voted on inclusion. Items receiving three or four votes (a majority) made it to the commenting stage, where each person individually wrote up their thoughts on photos they felt inclined to. No one could see what anyone else wrote (besides me of course 😈).

The general route was 香港 (Hong Kong), 阳朔 (Yangshuo) (where we met up with Eli), 昆明 (Kunming), 峨眉山 (Emei Mountain), 成都 (Chengdu), 天水 (Tianshui), and finally 北京 (Beijing), as with all trips there were significantly fewer photos towards the end, but still enough!

<span class="comment-author">Sam: </span><span class="comment">Our journey began (a member short - Eli was still up in 上海 (Shanghai) being a camp counselor) in the towering city of 香港 (Hong Kong). My Chinese was useless half the time here, as the locals speak Cantonese, which is entirely inoperable with the Mandarin I had learned. But I've already talked some about Hong Kong [before](http://localhost:8000/2019/11/16/hongkong/)!</span>

<span class="comment-author">Dad: </span><span class="comment">A beautiful city wrapped up in an ugly power struggle. Didn't see any violence during our brief stay, but our hearts go out to those who do.</span>

Still, if you go to Hong Kong you *have* to get dimsum, so we went to 添好運 (Tim Ho Wan) one of the most famous spots in the city. What I'm holding is fried milk - absolutely delicious.</span>

<span class="comment-author">Eli: </span><span class="comment">(Not pictured) There was a setup in this building with three TVs side-by-side with an advertisement playing across all three of them. If I remember correctly, the TVs would also move. *(Editor's note: Eli was not actually here, and so must be remembering a different train station)*</span>

<span class="comment-author">Sam: </span><span class="comment">Our second destination - 阳朔 (Yangshuo) ! The Chinese have a saying about this place - 桂林山水甲天下，阳朔山水甲桂林 (Guilin shanshui jiatianxia, Yangshuo shanshui jiaguilin "Guilin is the most beautiful place in China, and Yangshuo is the most beautiful place in Guilin). We spent about a week here and it was incredibly hot and humid and filled with other Chinese tourists - definitely not a gentle introduction 😂</span>

<span class="comment-author">Eli: </span><span class="comment">Yangshuo was surrounded by these enormous beautiful karsts. The city was pretty flat, so the karsts always claimed the top half of your vision.</span>

<span class="comment-author">Eli: </span><span class="comment">There were a huge number of street vendors in Yangshuo that seemed to be making a living off of selling very cheap novelty items. I’m not sure how.</span>

<span class="comment-author">Sam: </span><span class="comment">I'm with Eli on this one. Frankly a large part of the Chinese economy baffles me. I remember staying in a block of hostels during [my time in 秦皇岛 (qinhuangdao)](/2019/05/25/free/) where in the tiny little alley leading to my place there were four convenience stores. Four! I think what us Americans fail to grasp is that China is four times as populated as the US - so everywhere we would expect only one of a certain business to survive there's room for four.</span>

<span class="comment-author">Sam: </span><span class="comment">Our first 火锅 (huoguo "hot pot") meal of the trip! We were joined by Raven, a friend of Eli's who had been a counselor with him at the summer camp up in 上海 (Shanghai). She and Eli were actually here on the dime of that program and they spent the whole week together. The four horsemen didn't officially start travelling together until our next destination, 昆明 (Kunming). (PS if any friends of Raven's are reading this you should ask her about her train ride to 成都（Chengdu))</span>

<span class="comment-author">Sam: </span><span class="comment">One of the most famous attractions of 阳朔 (Yangshuo) were the bamboo boat rides down the rivers. Only one is pictured here but there must have been thousands that went down the river every day during the peak season. Dad and I would rent mopeds and drive out to bridge over the river and watch the endless horde of raft guides pole their way down the river...</span>

<span class="comment-author">Dad: </span><span class="comment">This is actual bamboo. Many of the boats on the river were made of PVC pipe.</span>

<div class="post-image">
  <img src="/assets/four-horsemen/twenty_yuan.jpg" />

<span class="comment-author">Sam: </span><span class="comment">And the king of all the raft rides was the one past a particular spot on the 丽江 (lijiang "Li river") which is featured on the back of the 20元 (yuan) bill. Dad kept insisting that the view didn't match the drawing, but I think his eyes are just getting old...</span>

<span class="comment-author">Eli: </span><span class="comment">If I remember correctly, there was some debate involved in finding the right angle that matched the bill.</span>

<span class="comment-author">Max: </span><span class="comment">Tourist photo :P</span>

<span class="comment-author">Max: </span><span class="comment">The ride down the river was nice to look at but it made me very sad - the roar of the engines (I had to wear earplugs), the plastic boats, the incessant stream of people coming and going. It made me think of the fish and the birds whose home this place is.</span>

<span class="comment-author">Dad: </span><span class="comment">It didn't really look like this. But it could have.</span>

<span class="comment-author">Sam: </span><span class="comment">Max sums it up well here - we were required to wear life vests and we weren't allowed to reach out of the boat and touch the water or anything. All we were allowed to do was sit there and squint up at the karsts and be deafened by the engine. Next time I'd just find a teahouse and enjoy the view there.</span>

<span class="comment-author">Sam: </span><span class="comment">Sometime during the week Max wandered into a 太极 (taiji "Taichi") school over on the East side of the city. He fell in love with the place and spent the remaining days in 阳朔 (Yangshuo) coming here, and with Eli hanging out with Raven, Dad and I got to roam by ourselves. Max invited us to come visit and so on our last day we went to see what he had learned. He taught us push hands, which he's doing in the picture above, and both Dad and I gave it a shot 😁</span>

<span class="comment-author">Max: </span><span class="comment">This school was amazing. From the first day I arrived they welcomed me like family (uncle Zhang cooked some of the best food I had in all of China) and taught me the best they could. This is where I learned to truly love taiji, and learned something more of it's martial applications such as Toushou (push hands), pictured here.</span>

<span class="comment-author">Dad: </span><span class="comment">Cloud hands! *(Editor's note: I think he means "push hands", which is the name of the activity that Max is currently engaged in)*</span>

<span class="comment-author">Sam: </span><span class="comment">One time Dad, Max and I took the mopeds down to a small "beach" (mostly rocks) on the side of the 丽江 (lijiang "Li river") and spent the afternoon swimming 😊</span>

<span class="comment-author">Eli: </span><span class="comment">WITH NATURE HATH WE BEEN BLESSED</span>

<span class="comment-author">Max: </span><span class="comment">Once when I was swimming in the rivers I saw an old man way out in the middle, floating along, singing/chanting at the top of his lungs. Love that dude. I want to be him in 50 years.</span>

We transferred trains in 贵阳 (Guiyang) which is where this picture was taken. It may look huge, but this isn't even a particularly big train station by Chinese standards!</span>

The service people were so delighted that I spoke Chinese that they insisted on helping us take a picture, and also taking pictures with us!</span>

<span class="comment-author">Eli: </span><span class="comment">Dry pot! Spicy noodles with toppings but no broth. Sam told us that it’s considered a snack, but it felt like a full meal to my non-Chinese tummy.</span>

During this period Eli found and befriended a cat who seemed to be a temple native.</span>

<span class="comment-author">Eli: </span><span class="comment">It’s not visible, but this place had a great view; you could oversee the whole city. There were several groups of high-rises, each of which appeared to be the same building duplicated twelve or thirteen times.</span>

<span class="comment-author">Sam: </span><span class="comment">After 峨眉山 (emeishan "Emei Mountain") we hopped on a train just a couple hours north to China's hot pot capital: 成都 (Chengdu). 属九香 is absolutely one of my favorite spots and what I took us to immediately upon arriving 😁</span>

<span class="comment-author">Eli: </span><span class="comment">I look bored, but I was actually usually pretty excited to eat it. I was too weak for the spicy broth, though, and I think I was probably missing out.</span>

<span class="comment-author">Eli: </span><span class="comment">Bikes were super common. There were several companies ala Lime, so you coulda basically get a bike wherever you were. Mopeds were also really common. Cars weren’t uncommon, but some places in China—Shanghai in particular, I believe—has a limit on the number of cars allowed in the road. (I think the US should copy this.)</span>

<span class="comment-author">Sam: </span><span class="comment">At this point in our trip we re-separated. Max, after doing some sniffing around online, had found out about a Taoism class taught up on 武当山 (wudangshan "Wudang Mountain") and was dying to check it out. So he bought some train tickets to strike out East as Dad, Eli and I turned North-Westward. We arrived at the ancient city of 天水 (Tianshui) in the province of 甘肃 (Gansu). This picture was taken at the 麦积山 (maijishan "Maiji Mountain") grottoes - some of the oldest and largest Buddhist carvings in all of China. Carved into a sheer cliff face you took some pretty steep stairs to see them up close.</span>

<span class="comment-author">Max: </span><span class="comment">This place was incredible. A secret sanctuary of esoteric knowledge made by a 60 year old man who had been studying taoist arts since 6 years old. He rehabilitated an old temple by himself up in the Wudang Mountains (the mythological birthplace of Taiji), and for years has been teaching Westerners willing to make the pilgrimage and sleep on hard cots in basic cabins. (Oh, and pay money).The community of people there was very genuine, from various walks of life, all seeking something and somehow finding their way to this place. I didn't want to leave.</span>

<span class="comment-author">Eli: </span><span class="comment">Another questionable Chinese -> English translation. Sam said that it’s simply because they didn’t care that much about having accurate translations. One in a hotel had a display with the current date and “week 4” on it. Week 4 of what, we wondered? Turns out it meant Thursday, because days of the week in Chinese literally translate as “Week” + 1/2/3/4/5/6, where 1 is Monday and 6 is Saturday. (Sunday isn’t 7 but instead gets the character rì, meaning sun, or the character tiān, meaning day)</span>

<span class="comment-author">Sam: </span><span class="comment">Max and Dad were both highly interested in the Chinese Museum of Art - Eli tagged along cause he was a good sport 😂 They have some permanent exhibits around calligraphy and, of course, the famous Chinese style ink paintings, but this time when we went they also had an exhibit on Tibetan artists. It was incredibly pro-Communist and obviously heavily filtered - Dad walked right by the exhibit muttering something about "not even wanting to look at it."</span>

---

And that about wraps it up! We did so much more than what shows in the photos, especially in 北京 (Beijing) where photo taking had dwindled due to exhaustion. Dad hauled his camera around the whole time and many of these photos are his, but you should check out some of the other ones he took [here](https://www.normanmaynard.com/china) as well!

If you asked me what my favorite part of the trip was I would probably say it was being able to eat together with my family. I had been abroad for over half a year and during the last four months in particular I mostly ate alone. So it was wonderful to have a big ol' hotpot meal with giant bottles of 2.5% alcohol by volume beers, an infinite flow of food till we burst, and friendly faces to share everything with 😊 As for what the three of them liked best... well you'll have to ask them!

<!--
"A trip of a lifetime!" Dad declared to me over the phone. "We'll get all four of us together and go over to visit you in China! Sometime during the summer, when we're all on break and you're done with your internship. And we definitely have to go to Kunming because my neighbor is from there and she's showed me all these photos of how beautiful it is."

And so after hours of discussion and planning and confusion and booking the time had come. [Max and Dad had joined me in Hong Kong](/2019/11/16/hongkong/) and the littlest, Eli, had just finished up his stint as a summer camp counselor up in 上海 (Shanghai). The month long family trip had just begun!

But instead of hearing the adventure from just one perspective, why not all four? Between us we took nearly 900 photos/videos over the course of the trip.
